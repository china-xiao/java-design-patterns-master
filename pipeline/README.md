## Intent
Allows processing of data in a series of stages by giving in an initial input and passing the processed output to be used by the next stages.

## Applicability
Use the Pipeline pattern when you want to

* execute individual stages that yields a final value
* add readability to complex sequence of operations by providing a fluent builder as an interface
* improve testability of code since stages will most likely be doing a single thing, complying to the [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](https://java-design-patterns.com/principles/#single-responsibility-principle)

## Typical Use Case

* implement stages and execute them in an ordered manner

## Real world examples

* [java.util.Stream](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html)
* [Maven Build Lifecycle](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html)
* [Functional Java](https://github.com/functionaljava/functionaljava)
